# **About Me**

Hi I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

<p>Engineer on a Quest to Give Robots Free Will (Responsibly, of course)</p>

<p>I thrive on building things—constantly pushing the limits of what's possible with robotics, automation, and AI. My pursuit of happ’y’ness is creating technology that people can trust, enjoy, and feel connected to. That adrenaline rush when a product I've built makes someone’s life easier? That’s my fuel.</p>

<p>Beyond engineering, I’m an adventurer, always exploring who I am and how I can learn more. I live by the mantra, "Learn as if you were to live forever." It's this insatiable curiosity that lights my path, leading me to remarkable experiences and people who’ve shown me that passion truly is highly flammable (in the best way).</p>

<p>With over 7 years of full-stack experience, specializing in robotics and automation, I’ve honed the craft of developing scalable, user-centered products. If it’s robust, impactful, and makes life better for people, you’ll find me somewhere in the code, building it.</p>
